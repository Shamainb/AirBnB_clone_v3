AirBnB Clone - RESTful API v3
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is based on the principles of REST, which is an acronym for Representational State Transfer. RESTful APIs provide a way for different computer systems to communicate over a network (typically the internet) and interact with resources (such as data or services) in a standardized way.

The AirBnB Clone - RESTful API, the aim for this project is to replicate the functionality of the AirBnB website's backend, providing a RESTful API interface for interacting with AirBnB-like resources.

Command Interpreter:
The command interpreter used in the AirBnB Clone - RESTful API project is typically a combination of web frameworks and libraries that handle HTTP requests and responses. Commonly used frameworks for building RESTful APIs in Python include Flask, Django, and FastAPI.
Functionalities of this command interpreter:
Handling HTTP Requests: The command interpreter receives HTTP requests from clients, which can include various methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Routing: It routes incoming requests to the appropriate functions or handlers based on the URL endpoints.
Serialization and Deserialization: It serializes incoming data from clients into appropriate data structures and deserializes outgoing data from the application into a format suitable for HTTP responses (e.g., JSON).
Data Validation: It validates incoming data against predefined schemas or models to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Interaction with the Database: It interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on AirBnB-like resources (e.g., users, listings, bookings).
Authentication and Authorization: It handles user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources or perform specific actions.
Error Handling: It handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate error responses to clients in case of invalid requests or server-side errors.
